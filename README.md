某工厂生产的一种产品由A,B两种零件各一个组装而成(组装时间忽略不计),该工厂 有4条流水线生产这两种零件,一天的生产数量如下(单位:个): 
A product produced by a certain factory is assembled from two parts, A and B, with assembly time ignored. The factory has four assembly lines producing these two parts, and the daily production quantity is as follows (unit: pieces):


\      Day1      Day2      Day3      Day4
      
A      80        90        70        60

B      100       120       110       70


程序需要提前设定,所以每条流水线一天只能生产同一种零件,第二天可以更换。
The program needs to be pre-set, so each assembly line can only produce the same type of part per day, which can be replaced the next day.

如果4条流水线都开通,7天最多生产该产品多少件。
If all four production lines are open, how many pieces of the product can be produced in 7 days at most.
